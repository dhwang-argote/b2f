                    Sports picking and related activities, including those
                    referenced by or undertaken through Bet 2 Fund, involve a
                    substantial risk of financial loss and are not suitable for
                    every participant. Betting market valuations are highly
                    volatile and can vary significantly between sportsbooks. Due
                    to the leveraged nature of betting, even minor changes in
                    odds can result in significant fluctuations in simulated
                    account results, including both large gains and substantial
                    losses.

                    Bet 2 Fund does not provide any betting advice, suggestions,

                    presented in a simulated environment, is not necessarily
                    indicative of future outcomes. There is no guarantee that
                    current or future performance will match past results, or
                    that losses will not occur.

                    All funded accounts offered by Bet 2 Fund are simulated
                    accounts and do not represent real-money trading or live
                    wagering accounts. These simulations utilize actual market
                    data and real-time quotes from established liquidity
                    providers but do not involve actual financial transactions.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Simulated performance results have inherent limitations.
                    Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do
                    not reflect real-world trading conditions. Because these
                    results do not represent actual trades, they may not
                    accurately reflect the impact of various market factors such
                    as liquidity constraints or execution timing. Additionally,
                    simulations are often designed with the benefit of
                    hindsight, which may lead to over- or underestimation of
                    potential outcomes.

                  <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    No guarantee is made that any simulated account will or is
                    likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those
                    presented. Picker performance showcased on Bet 2 Fund
                    represents past results in a simulated environment and
                    includes only those individuals who have agreed to have
                    their identities disclosed. These results are not indicative
                    of future performance and do not guarantee success.
                    Participation in sports picking, even in a simulated format,
                    carries significant financial risk and may not be
                    appropriate for all individuals.
